# trippy.py
A python application creating visuals for fun

This is a just-for-fun project.
I am hoping to learn about visual processing and Python best practices in the process.
Fell free to clone the repo and play with the code.

The program can be run by running "python trippy.py" in the project dir.
Several command line parameters can be given:
  fs/fullscreen = Fullscreen mode
  ss/screensize [x] [y] = Windowed with given resolution
  timing/t = print frame timings after each frame
  profiling/pr [frames] = Run and print python profiling at regular frame intervals
  notunnel/nt = Dont render the tunnel (easier on the eyes when youre not working on it)
  multithreading/mt = Use the multithreaded method of rendering the tunnel. (Not recommended)
